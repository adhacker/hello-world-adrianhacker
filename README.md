Introductory repository / Ideas
I am a Junior year Information Technology student at American Public University system.  I am on the software developer path, however, am interested and doing what I can to learn more every day about Web Design as well.  I have limited experience with C++ and Python.  I am looking to run some of my own projects on here and contribute to some projects as well.  One area that I do have professional expertise is the documentation area.  Look for my portfolio of work to appear here somewhere soon.
